## Title
Interactively building test forms from an IRT perspective: An application of R and Shiny

## Abstract
A common task for a data analyst is updating an analysis when the data changes. These tasks have led to integrated analysis documents; commonly employed with R and Rmarkdown. The advantage of these documents comes from little to no change needed in the analysis code to recreate the reporting document. What if this was taken a step further to remove the data analysis from the re-running of the analysis? This can be achieved with the programming language R through an interactive platform called Shiny. The Shiny package offers an interactive web framework where end users do not need to know R to be able to run the analysis. An example is shown with the task of building assessment forms. Items that make up a given test form are commonly swapped due to content, alignment, or statistical concerns before a final form is developed. Using R and Shiny, this process could be done in an interactive environment, where items can be swapped on the fly and the analysis could be updated immediately. This can improve workflow, provide a reduction in errors, and reduce many repetitive tasks that commonly fall to data analysts. Extensions to other interactive or repetitive tasks will be explored.

## Presenter
Brandon LeBeau - Assistant Professor at the University of Iowa

## Qualifications
Ph.D. in Quantitative Methods of Education from the University of Minnesota.
Teach an online course exploring computer packages for statistical analysis.
Author of three R packages hosted at https://github.com/lebebr01
Have used R for data analysis, visualization, and programming for the past 10 years.
Lastly, I have developed some basic Shiny applications over the past two years. This development has primarily focused on statistics education applications.

## Introductory Nature
The presentation will focus primarily on the benefits that Shiny offers to users from an interactive and repetitive data analysis tasks. In that sense it will be introductory as it will discuss the benefits of the interactive exploration of data. The presentation will also broadly discuss aspects of Shiny that can be helpful to users, but will not go into detail on the specific R code to create the application. This will be left to the great examples already created by Rstudio.

Note: If felt better suited, I'd also be interested in presenting a practical computing demo as well.
