## Title
Interactively building test forms from an IRT perspective: An application of R and Shiny

## Abstract
As a data analyst, one common problem comes when an analysis needs to be updated. This updating can be due to a multitude of scenarios. This idea has led to the strong push for reproducible and easily recreated analyses; which are commonly employed through the R and Rmarkdown framework. With only minor modifications to the code, the reporting document can be recreated quickly. What if this paradigm was taken a step further to remove the data analysis from the re-running of the analysis. This can be achieved with the programming language R with the use of an interactive platform called Shiny. The Shiny package created by Rstudio, offers a truly interactive web framework where end users do not need to know R to be able to run the analysis. This framework is shown with a task that is commonly a very interative process, the task of building assessment forms. Items that make up a given test form are commonly swapped due to content, alignment, or statistical concerns. Using the R and Shiny platform, this process could be done in an interactive environment, where items can be swapped on the fly and the analysis could be updated. This can greatly help improve workflow, provide a reduction in errors from copy and pasting, and reduce many repetitive tasks that commonly fall in data analysts laps.

## Introductory Nature
The presentation will focus primarily on the benefits that Shiny offers to users from an interactive data analysis perspective. In that sense it will be introductory as it will discuss the benefits of the interative nature of data. The presentation will also discuss broadly aspects of Shiny that can be helpful to users, but will not go into detail on the specific R code to program the application. This will be left to the great examples already created by Rstudio.
